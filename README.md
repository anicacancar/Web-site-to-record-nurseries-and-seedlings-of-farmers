# Web-app-to-record-nurseries-and-seedlings-of-farmers

The main goal of this application is to realize a web application for recording farmers and their nurseries. This application is using HTML and PHP programming languages and also JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, and MySQL technologies. 

In our application, we have three types of users: Administrator, Farmer, and Enterprise. All of those users can log in/log out. They can change their password and make an account if they aren't registered.

The administrator can accept or decline a registration request. He can also add, edit and delete users.

The farmer has his nurseries that are visible on his index page. He can open some of them and see the temperature and quantity of water inside. When he opens the nursery he sees the arrangement of seedlings with a dashboard. Then he can add water and set the temperature. When the farmer goes over some seedling, he sees its name, manufacturer, and progress bar which shows the progress of the plant until it becomes ready for transplanting. The farmer can take some preparation from his warehouse of that nursery and add it to the plant. The preparation speeds the progress of the plant for the specified time prescribed in the instructions of that preparation. When the plant is ready for transplanting he can pick it up. Also if some space in the nursery is free he can plant the plant in a nursery. A farmer can add a new nursery.

Farmer also can buy things from the online shop. All products from different companies are available in the online shop. There are two types of products, seedlings, and preparation. For all products is shown the average rating and availability. Detailed shown of the product presents all comments. A farmer can add a comment if he has already ordered that product. 

The company is represented by its worker. When the worker logs in, he can see all orders for his company. He can accept or decline the order. When he accepts order he employs one of his couriers. A worker can see all the offered products and rate for every product. 


In the picture below you can see one preview of the nursery:
