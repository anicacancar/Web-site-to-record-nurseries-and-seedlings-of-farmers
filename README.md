# Web-app-to-record-nurseries-and-seedlings-of-farmers

The main goal of this application is to realize web application for recording farmers and their nurseries. This application is using HTML and PHP programming languages and olso Java Script, CSS and MySQL technologies. 

In our application we have three types of users: Administrator, Farmer and Entrprise. All of those users can log in/log out. They can change their password and make an account if they aren't registrated.

Administrator can accept or decline request for registration. He can also add, edit and delete users.

Farmer has his own nurseries that are visible on his index page. He can open some of them and see the temperature and quantity of water insade. When he opens the nursery he sees the arrangement of seedlings with a dashboard. Then he can add water and set temperature. When farmer goes over some seedling, he sees it's name, manufacturer and progress bar which shows the progress of the plant until it becomes ready for transplanting. Farmer can take some preparation from his warehouse of that nursery and add it to the plant. The preparation speeds the progress of plant for specified time prescribed in the instructions of that preparation. When plant is ready for transplating he can pick it up. Also if some space in nurserie is free he can plant the plant in a nursery. Farmer can add new nurserie.

Farmer also can buy things from online shop. All products from different companies are available in online shop. There are two types of products, seedlings and preparation. For all products is shown the average rating and availability. Detailed shown of product presents all comments. Farmer can add comment if he has already oredered that product. 

Company is represented by it's worker. When worker logs in, he can see all orders for his company. He can accept or decline oreder. When he accepts order he employs one of his courires. Worker can see all the offered products and rate for every product.
